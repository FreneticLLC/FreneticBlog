# Contributing to the Frenetic LLC Blog

Public contributions to fix site issues or minor corrections to posts are welcome.

Beyond that, only members of the Frenetic LLC team should be writing posts here, naturally.

### How to Add a Post

In short: make a new file in `_posts` folder, named `[year]-[month]-[day]-[title].md`, and copy the header template from any other post and fill in the details.

If this is your first post, add yourself to `_data/authors.yml`

If you have images/assets, put them in `assets/postmedia/(yourposttitle)/`

When creating section headers, start at `##` - don't use `#`.

See also https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/ for more info about stuff to do in posts.

As we teach with all code work at Frenetic: the first thing you should do before getting started, is look through existing posts and how they work, and use them as a reference for how to do it yourself.
If your new post doesn't resemble the method of doing things that the existing posts use, you better have a specific reason you made an intentional change!

#### Writing Style

Break your posts down into clear sections and sub-sections, with paragraphs within.

For informational posts, add key takeaways clearly separated from the broad details, such as at the end of a section. Ensure you have a conclusion/summary at the end or beginning of the post.

Section headers should be written in Title Case.

For deeper headers (`####` or below), you might consider switching to a more informal format.
